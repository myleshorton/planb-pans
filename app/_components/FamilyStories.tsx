The immunologist read the antibodies. The gastroenterologist read the gut. A prior synthesis had called the whole thing “gut + neuroinflammation.” Every number that mattered was already on paper.

Three “unrelated” abnormalities, one cause.',

A prior immunologist had written “immune dysfunction” and left it there. Minta tied those exact numbers to the failure-to-clear pattern — then to the funding: the same bloodwork qualifies him for IVIG under national health coverage his mom could never have paid for privately.',
